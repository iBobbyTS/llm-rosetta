"""Routing layer — model/provider/shim resolution contract.

Defines the :class:`ResolvedRoute` data contract and :class:`Router`
protocol for resolving a model name into a target provider, shim config,
capabilities, and reasoning overrides.

This module lives in the core library (no network or gateway deps) so
any consumer (gateway, argo-proxy, CLI tools) can depend on it.

Transport config (e.g. :class:`~gateway.transport.ProviderInfo`) is
**not** part of the route — it's transport-specific and returned
separately by each :class:`Router` implementation.
